# HD_Util
A Python tool I created which also utilizes PowerShell to help in the daily jobs of help desk assistant. 

*Made for Active Directory domain environment.
*Only works on Windows OS.
*Requires python3 installed.

Instead of using different tools for the different tasks of helpdesk,
I found it more comfortable to have one tool where you can do most of the basic tasks.

Also if you are just getting started in IT I bet you don't know how to remotley manage computers, I didn't.
Feel free to view the code and see which commands are used and expand your knowledge :)

I probably won't be editing and improving this tool since I have no need for it anymore, but who knnows right?
